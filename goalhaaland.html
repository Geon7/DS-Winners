        <h1>Erling Haaland's goals</h1>
        <p>Erling Haaland's 2022/23 season is officially the most prolific in front of goal in the Premier League era.

            The numbers behind Haalandâ€™s latest Premier League record
            The Norwegian scored his 50th City goal in the 2-1 win over Fulham, extending his record at scoring more in a single season for a Premier League club than anyone has ever managed before.
            
            Ruud van Nistelrooy (2002/03) and Mo Salah (2017/18) previously jointly held the record with 44 strikes across all competitions.
            
            Haaland reached 50 goals from 44 games, scoring 34 in the Premier League, 12 in the Champions League, three in the FA Cup and one in the Carabao Cup.
            
            With six Premier League matches to go and the Blues still alive in both the Champions League and FA Cup, he will be hoping to increase his total further.
