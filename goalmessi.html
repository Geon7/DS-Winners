        <h1>Lionel Messi's goals in Barcelona</h1>
        <p>When Barcelona signed the young Argentine forward in 2004, the world had no idea that he would become one of the greatest players to have donned the iconic red and blue jersey.

            During his jaw-dropping career at Barcelona, Messi scored a mind-boggling 672 goals in 778 appearances, breaking numerous records during his spell at Camp Nou.
            
            He scored his first goal in 2005 against Albacete in a jam-packed Camp Nou.
            
            The Argentine's last goal for the Spanish giants came in a 2-1 defeat to Celta Vigo at home.
            
            But what he had done between the two goals will live in the minds of football fans forever.
            
            The Argentine captured a club-record 35 trophies for Barcelona, while also picking up the prestigious Ballon d’Or seven times.</p>

            <h2>Lionel Messi Goals in Argentina</h2>
            <p>Messi currently shares the podium with Cristiano Ronaldo and Ali Daei as far as international goals are concerned.

                The forward has scored 90 goals for his beloved country and is their all-time top goal scorer.
                
                The only blotch on his international career was the lack of trophies he had won for his country.
                
                Having lost the 2014 World Cup final in Brazil, it looked like an international trophy would elude one of the greatest of the game.
                
                But Argentina’s luck changed in 2021 when Messi guided La Albiceleste to the Copa America title along with a Finalissima Trophy in 2022.
                
                Come the World Cup in Qatar, Messi will have his eyes on the biggest prize once again.</p>
            <h3>Lionel Messi Goals in Paris</h3>
            <p>In the summer of 2021, Messi was forced to switch clubs owing to the Spanish outfit’s financial crisis.

                The Argentine’s first season with PSG was not quite up to his standards as he was unable to score as regularly as we had gotten used to.
                
                Come 2022, a more settled Messi looks in fine form once more.
                
                Under the new leadership of Christophe Galtier, Messi along with his partners in crime Neymar and Kylian Mbappe has formed a lethal trio and will look to bag all pieces of silverware available to them this season.</p>
