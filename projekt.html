            <h2>Manchester City</h2>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>Manchester City Football Club was founded in 1880 under the name St. Mark's West Gorton at the initiative of the members of the church of St. Mark's Church of England , West Gorton, Manchester . Against the background of high unemployment, very large social problems arose, such as alcoholism and violence between certain gangs. Arthur Connell (rector of St. Mark's Church) and his daughter Anne Connel became involved in reducing these problems and therefore created a cricket club in 1875 . In 1880 two churchwardens of St Mark's - William Beastow and Thomas Goodbehere - also started a football team called"St. Mark's West Gorton" . Sometimes this was called West Gorton (St Mark's) .
